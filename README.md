# Financial Fraud Detection Model

A machine learning model to detect fraudulent financial transactions using Python, Pandas, and XGBoost. This project was completed as part of a case study to demonstrate skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

## Business Context
The goal of this project is to build a model for a financial company to proactively detect fraudulent transactions, aiming to reduce financial losses while minimizing disruption to legitimate customers.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a synthetic financial dataset from Kaggle, simulating mobile money transactions. It contains over 6 million records and 10 features, including transaction type, amount, and account balances.

## Key Results
The final XGBoost model demonstrated excellent performance on the test set:
* **Recall:** 99.5% (Successfully identified 1,635 out of 1,643 fraudulent transactions)
* **Precision:** 97% (Maintained a very low rate of false alarms)

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost
* Seaborn & Matplotlib
